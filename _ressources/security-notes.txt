The choice between **Spring Security** and **Spring OAuth2 Resource Server** depends on the **authentication and authorization** requirements of your application. Here's a detailed comparison to help you decide:

---

### **1. Use Spring Security Only**  
- **When to Use:**  
  - Your application requires **basic authentication** (username and password).  
  - You're building a simple system without an **OAuth2 or OpenID Connect (OIDC)** integration.  
  - Authentication is managed directly by your backend (e.g., with a database or in-memory users).  

- **Common Use Case:**  
  - Internal applications or simpler setups where user identity is not managed externally.  

- **Pros:**  
  - Simpler to set up and configure.  
  - Ideal for quick prototypes or internal tools.  

- **Cons:**  
  - Doesn't scale well if you need **third-party login** (e.g., Google, Facebook) or **token-based authentication**.  
  - Harder to integrate with Single Sign-On (SSO) providers.

### **2. Use Spring OAuth2 Resource Server**  
- **When to Use:**  
  - Your app requires **token-based authentication** using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** or **opaque tokens**.  
  - You plan to integrate with an **identity provider (IdP)** like **Keycloak, Okta, Auth0, or Azure AD** for authentication and authorization.  
  - You need **fine-grained access control** based on scopes, roles, or claims in tokens.  

- **Common Use Case:**  
  - Modern distributed systems using microservices or Single Page Applications (SPA) with **Angular**.  
  - Applications leveraging **OAuth2 flows** for authentication.  

- **Pros:**  
  - Secure and scalable for enterprise-level applications.  
  - Supports external identity providers and Single Sign-On (SSO).  
  - Ideal for securing REST APIs with **Bearer Tokens**.  

- **Cons:**  
  - Slightly more complex configuration compared to basic Spring Security.  
  - Requires setting up or integrating with an identity provider.  

---

### **Recommendation for Angular + Spring Boot App**  
- If your Angular app communicates with the Spring Boot backend via **REST APIs** and you want to use **token-based authentication** for scalability and security, **Spring OAuth2 Resource Server** is the **better choice**.  
- This approach works well with **JWT** tokens and modern security patterns like **OAuth 2.0** and **OIDC**.  
- You'll also be ready for future enhancements, such as integrating with external identity providers.
